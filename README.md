# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

# My First Serious ReadME

URL to GitHub hosted website: https://johnk9000.github.io/HW2/

This exercise was intended to nail down the fundamentals of CSS positioning and using some pre-made bootstrap components to make a functional website.

The bootstrap component used is the Bootstrap 4 NavBar (docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) in all pages and the bootstrap 4 forms component (docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/).

The html repository is comprised of three pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` which represents the "About Me", "Portfolio", and "contact, all located at the root of the repo. A separate css file, titled `style.css` is located in the `/CSS` directory while image files used for the art portfolio section is loaded into `/Photo` directory. Because the picture used in the About Me section is a low-res portable image rather than a lossless export of photographs, the profile picture is located in the `/Images` directory.

# Revision Log

* First few commits were version 1 of the website with a different aesthetic look and many non-working elements

* Commits made since Tuesday, June 16th 2020 are version 2s with the current design aesthetic


## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.


### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.


### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project


### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).


## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
